# Cryptocurrencies

This is a work that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for new investment.

The data, you may find it in the link: .......,  will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output I decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm. Data visualizations are used also in the work.
